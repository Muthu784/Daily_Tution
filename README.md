### Extended description 

This project is a modern, production‑ready React admin dashboard scaffolded with Vite for fast dev builds and HMR. It ships with a rich set of UI and data components out of the box: interactive charts (ApexCharts), advanced data tables (Grid.js), calendars and scheduling (FullCalendar) form handling with validation (React Hook Form + Yup), drag‑and‑drop (SortableJS and DnD), rich text editing (Quill), file uploads (Dropzone), notifications and alerts (React Toastify and SweetAlert2), and more. Routing is handled by React Router, styling uses Bootstrap/Sass, and the setup includes sensible defaults like an `@` alias to `src` for clean imports.
